## Future forecast of time-series prediction on bike sharing demand dataset
1. Overview of data set and analysis
2. Prediction of missing values (from test set)
3. Filling different missing values (those which were not present in train nor test dataset)
4. Making future prediction with the usage of <em>ExponentialSmoothing</em>
